## Tail Recursion vs Non-Tail Recursion

Recursion can be categorized into two types based on how the recursive function calls are made: **Tail Recursion** and **Non-Tail Recursion**. Understanding the difference between the two is important for optimizing recursive solutions and managing memory usage efficiently.

### 1. Tail Recursion
**Tail recursion** occurs when the recursive call is the last operation in the function. In other words, the function returns the result of the recursive call directly, without performing any further operations after the recursive call.

In tail recursion, the current function's state (local variables, return address, etc.) does not need to be stored in the call stack because there are no pending operations. This allows compilers or interpreters to optimize the recursion by reusing the same stack frame for each recursive call, reducing memory usage. This optimization is known as **Tail Call Optimization (TCO)**.

#### Example: Tail Recursive Factorial (Python)

In a tail-recursive version of the factorial function, the result is accumulated during the recursive calls, and no computation is done after the recursive call.

```python
def tail_recursive_factorial(n, accumulator=1):
    # Base case: if n is 0, return the accumulated result
    if n == 0:
        return accumulator
    # Tail recursion: the recursive call is the last action
    return tail_recursive_factorial(n - 1, accumulator * n)

# Testing tail-recursive factorial
num = 5
print(f"Tail-Recursive Factorial of {num} is: {tail_recursive_factorial(num)}")
```

#### Explanation:
- The function `tail_recursive_factorial(n, accumulator)` calls itself with a decremented value of `n` and the result accumulated so far in the `accumulator` variable.
- Once the base case (`n == 0`) is reached, it returns the accumulated value.
- No computation is done after the recursive call, making it **tail-recursive**.

#### Benefits of Tail Recursion:
- **Optimization**: The function can be optimized by the compiler to avoid adding new frames to the call stack. This reduces memory usage and prevents stack overflow for large input values.
- **Efficiency**: It performs better in terms of memory when Tail Call Optimization is supported by the compiler or interpreter.

### 2. Non-Tail Recursion
**Non-tail recursion** occurs when there are pending operations after the recursive call. In this case, the function needs to keep track of the current state (local variables, return address, etc.) because further operations must be performed after the recursive call returns.

As a result, non-tail-recursive functions tend to use more memory since each call adds a new frame to the call stack, and these frames cannot be discarded until the final result is computed.

#### Example: Non-Tail Recursive Factorial (Python)

The typical factorial function is non-tail recursive because it multiplies the result of the recursive call after it returns.

```python
def non_tail_recursive_factorial(n):
    # Base case: if n is 0, return 1
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    # Non-tail recursion: multiply result after the recursive call
    return n * non_tail_recursive_factorial(n - 1)

# Testing non-tail recursive factorial
num = 5
print(f"Non-Tail Recursive Factorial of {num} is: {non_tail_recursive_factorial(num)}")
```

#### Explanation:
- The function `non_tail_recursive_factorial(n)` calls itself with a decremented value of `n`, but the multiplication (`n * factorial(n - 1)`) happens **after** the recursive call.
- Since the multiplication is performed after the recursive call, it cannot be optimized using tail call optimization. The stack frames must be retained until all recursive calls complete.

#### Drawbacks of Non-Tail Recursion:
- **Memory Usage**: Since each recursive call adds a new frame to the call stack and these frames cannot be discarded, the memory usage increases. This can lead to stack overflow errors for large inputs.
- **Less Efficient**: Non-tail recursion generally consumes more memory and may be slower for larger inputs compared to tail recursion (if TCO is available).

### Key Differences Between Tail Recursion and Non-Tail Recursion:

| Aspect                 | Tail Recursion                             | Non-Tail Recursion                      |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Definition**          | Recursive call is the last action          | Operations are performed after the recursive call |
| **Memory Efficiency**   | More memory efficient due to tail call optimization | Less memory efficient as new stack frames are added |
| **Tail Call Optimization** | Can be optimized to reuse the stack frame | Cannot be optimized since operations are pending |
| **Example**             | `return tail_recursive_function()`         | `return operation + non_tail_recursive_function()` |
| **Risk of Stack Overflow** | Less prone to stack overflow             | More prone to stack overflow for large inputs |
