# String Mastery: From Beginner to Advanced

## 1. Introduction to Strings
### What are Strings?
A string is a sequence of characters. In most programming languages, strings are immutable.

### Defining a String
Strings are usually defined with quotes.
```python
my_string = "Hello, World!"
```

### String Literals
- Single quotes: `'single quotes'`
- Double quotes: `"double quotes"`
- Triple quotes for multi-line: `'''triple quoted string'''`

#### Interview Questions:
1. What are strings, and how are they stored in memory?
2. How can you define a string in your language of choice?

---

## 2. Basic String Operations
### Accessing Characters in a String
You can access characters using indexing.
```python
char = my_string[0]  # H
```

### String Length
Use `len()` to get the length of a string.
```python
length = len(my_string)  # 13
```

### String Concatenation
Concatenation is done using the `+` operator.
```python
full_string = "Hello" + " " + "World"
```

### String Repetition
Use the `*` operator to repeat a string.
```python
repeat_string = "Ha" * 3  # HaHaHa
```

### String Formatting
You can format strings using the `format()` method or f-strings (in Python).
```python
formatted_string = "My name is {}".format("Pawan")
f_string = f"My name is {name}"
```

### Escape Sequences
Use backslashes for special characters.
- `\n` for newline
- `\t` for tab

#### Interview Questions:
1. How can you access individual characters in a string?
2. Explain how string concatenation works.
3. What are escape sequences? Can you give examples?

## 3. String Methods
Here are some common methods you can use with strings:

### Changing Case
- `upper()`: Converts string to uppercase.
- `lower()`: Converts string to lowercase.
- `capitalize()`: Capitalizes the first letter of the string.
- `title()`: Capitalizes the first letter of each word.

### Trimming Whitespace
- `strip()`: Removes whitespace from both ends.
- `lstrip()`: Removes whitespace from the left.
- `rstrip()`: Removes whitespace from the right.

### Finding and Replacing
- `replace(old, new)`: Replaces occurrences of a substring.
- `find(sub)`: Returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring.
- `count(sub)`: Counts the occurrences of a substring.

### Checking Start and End
- `startswith(prefix)`: Checks if the string starts with the specified prefix.
- `endswith(suffix)`: Checks if the string ends with the specified suffix.

### Splitting and Joining
- `split()`: Splits the string into a list.
- `join(iterable)`: Joins an iterable into a string.

#### Interview Questions:
1. What is the difference between `find()` and `index()` methods?
2. How can you split a string by a delimiter? Give an example.
3. How would you check if a string starts or ends with a particular substring?

## 4. String Slicing
### Basic Slicing
```python
slice = my_string[0:5]  # Hello
```

### Slicing with Step
```python
slice = my_string[::2]  # HloWrd
```

### Reversing a String using Slicing
```python
reverse_string = my_string[::-1]
```

#### Interview Questions:
1. How does string slicing work? Provide an example.
2. How would you reverse a string using slicing?
3. Explain the significance of the step parameter in slicing.

## 5. String Immutability
### Understanding Immutability
Strings cannot be changed after creation. To modify a string, you must create a new one.

#### Interview Questions:
1. Why are strings immutable?
2. How can you change a string without directly modifying it?

---

## 6. Advanced String Operations
### String Interpolation
String interpolation allows embedding variables inside strings.

### f-Strings (Python)
```python
name = "Pawan"
greet = f"Hello, {name}!"
```

### Raw Strings
Raw strings ignore escape sequences, useful for regular expressions.
```python
raw_string = r"Backslash: \\"
```

#### Interview Questions:
1. What is string interpolation, and how is it useful?
2. How do raw strings differ from regular strings?

---

## 7. String Encoding and Decoding
### Encoding a String
```python
encoded_string = "Pawan".encode('utf-8')
```

### Decoding a String
```python
decoded_string = encoded_string.decode('utf-8')
```

#### Interview Questions:
1. What is the difference between encoding and decoding?
2. Why is encoding necessary when dealing with strings?

---

## 8. Regular Expressions (RegEx)
Regular expressions are used for string pattern matching.
- `re.search()`: Searches for a pattern.
- `re.match()`: Matches from the beginning.
- `re.findall()`: Finds all occurrences.
- `re.sub()`: Replaces matches.

#### Interview Questions:
1. What are regular expressions, and why are they useful in string manipulation?
2. Explain the difference between `re.search()` and `re.match()`.

---

## 9. String Search Algorithms
### Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm
An efficient string searching algorithm.

### Rabin-Karp Algorithm
Uses hashing to find patterns in a string.

#### Interview Questions:
1. What are some efficient string search algorithms, and how do they work?
2. Can you explain how the KMP algorithm improves pattern matching?

---

## 10. String Compression and Decompression
### Run-Length Encoding (RLE)
A basic form of string compression.

#### Interview Questions:
1. What is Run-Length Encoding, and how does it compress a string?
2. Can you provide an example of a string compression technique?

---

## 11. String Parsing
### Tokenization
Splitting a string into tokens or smaller chunks.

#### Interview Questions:
1. What is string tokenization, and why is it used?
2. How can you convert a string into a list or a list into a string?

---

## 12. Unicode and Strings
### Introduction to Unicode
Unicode is a universal character encoding standard.

#### Interview Questions:
1. What is Unicode, and how does it differ from ASCII?
2. What are the different Unicode encoding formats like UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32?

## 13. Practical Use Cases
### Validating Email Addresses
You can use regular expressions to validate emails.

### URL Parsing
Breaking down URLs into components such as scheme, domain, etc.

### Password Strength Validation
Checking the strength of passwords based on length, special characters, etc.

### Text Analysis
Perform operations like word count, frequency analysis, etc.

#### Interview Questions:
1. How would you validate an email address using a regular expression?
2. What are some common use cases where string manipulation plays a critical role?
