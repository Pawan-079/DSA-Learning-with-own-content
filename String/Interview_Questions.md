# Strings: Interview Questions and Answers

## 1. **Basic String Manipulation**

### Q1: What is a string in programming?
**Answer**:  
A string is a sequence of characters, either as a literal constant or as some kind of variable. Strings are used to represent text and can be manipulated in many ways (slicing, concatenation, etc.).

### Q2: How do you reverse a string in Python?
**Answer**:  
You can reverse a string using slicing:  
```python
reversed_string = my_string[::-1]
```

### Q3: What is string concatenation?
**Answer**:  
String concatenation is the process of joining two or more strings end-to-end. In Python, you can concatenate using the `+` operator:
```python
result = "Hello" + " " + "World"
```

### Q4: How do you check if a string is a palindrome?
**Answer**:  
A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. To check if a string is a palindrome, compare the string with its reverse:
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]
```

## 2. **Intermediate String Manipulation**

### Q1: How do you count the frequency of characters in a string?
**Answer**:  
You can use a dictionary to count the frequency of each character:
```python
from collections import Counter
freq = Counter(my_string)
```

### Q2: How would you find the first non-repeating character in a string?
**Answer**:  
You can use a dictionary to store character frequencies and then iterate through the string to find the first character with a count of 1:
```python
def first_non_repeating(s):
    freq = {}
    for char in s:
        freq[char] = freq.get(char, 0) + 1
    for char in s:
        if freq[char] == 1:
            return char
    return None
```

### Q3: What is the difference between `split()` and `join()`?
**Answer**:  
- `split()`: Splits a string into a list using a specified delimiter.  
- `join()`: Joins elements of a list into a string with a specified separator.

Example:  
```python
"Hello World".split()  # ['Hello', 'World']
" ".join(['Hello', 'World'])  # "Hello World"
```

## 3. **String Searching and Pattern Matching**

### Q1: What is the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm used for?
**Answer**:  
The **KMP algorithm** is used for efficient substring searches. It avoids redundant comparisons by preprocessing the pattern to determine where mismatches can lead to further comparisons. This preprocessing generates an LPS (Longest Prefix Suffix) array.

### Q2: What is the Rabin-Karp algorithm, and how does it work?
**Answer**:  
The **Rabin-Karp algorithm** uses hashing to find a pattern within a string. It computes hash values for the pattern and the text and compares them. If the hash values match, a character-by-character comparison is made to confirm the match.

### Q3: How would you implement a brute-force string matching algorithm?
**Answer**:  
You can iterate through each substring of the text and compare it with the pattern:
```python
def brute_force_search(text, pattern):
    for i in range(len(text) - len(pattern) + 1):
        if text[i:i+len(pattern)] == pattern:
            return i
    return -1
```

## 4. **Advanced String Algorithms**

### Q1: Explain the Boyer-Moore algorithm.
**Answer**:  
The **Boyer-Moore algorithm** is an efficient string matching algorithm. It preprocesses the pattern to determine how far to shift the pattern when a mismatch occurs. It uses two heuristic methods: the **bad character rule** and the **good suffix rule**. The algorithm scans the pattern from right to left.

### Q2: How does the Z algorithm work for pattern searching?
**Answer**:  
The **Z algorithm** preprocesses the input to create a Z array, where each element `Z[i]` represents the length of the substring starting from `i` that matches the prefix of the string. It helps in finding occurrences of a pattern efficiently.

### Q3: What is the Suffix Array, and where is it used?
**Answer**:  
A **Suffix Array** is an array of all suffixes of a given string sorted in lexicographical order. It is used in applications like substring search, string compression, and bioinformatics.

## 5. **String Dynamic Programming**

### Q1: How do you solve the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem?
**Answer**:  
The **Longest Common Subsequence** problem can be solved using dynamic programming by building a table to store the LCS length for substrings. Here's an example:
```python
def lcs(X, Y):
    m = len(X)
    n = len(Y)
    L = [[0] * (n+1) for _ in range(m+1)]

    for i in range(1, m+1):
        for j in range(1, n+1):
            if X[i-1] == Y[j-1]:
                L[i][j] = L[i-1][j-1] + 1
            else:
                L[i][j] = max(L[i-1][j], L[i][j-1])
    return L[m][n]
```

### Q2: How do you find the longest palindromic substring using dynamic programming?
**Answer**:  
You can use dynamic programming by checking all substrings and storing whether they are palindromes:
```python
def longest_palindrome(s):
    n = len(s)
    dp = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    max_len = 1
    start = 0

    for i in range(n):
        dp[i][i] = True

    for i in range(n-1):
        if s[i] == s[i+1]:
            dp[i][i+1] = True
            start = i
            max_len = 2

    for length in range(3, n+1):
        for i in range(n-length+1):
            j = i + length - 1
            if dp[i+1][j-1] and s[i] == s[j]:
                dp[i][j] = True
                start = i
                max_len = length

    return s[start:start + max_len]
```

## 6. **String Problems in Interviews**

### Q1: What is the "anagram" problem?
**Answer**:  
The **anagram** problem asks you to determine if two strings are anagrams, meaning they have the same characters with the same frequencies. The simplest approach is to sort both strings and compare:
```python
def are_anagrams(str1, str2):
    return sorted(str1) == sorted(str2)
```

### Q2: How do you find the longest substring without repeating characters?
**Answer**:  
You can use a sliding window approach to track characters that have appeared so far:
```python
def longest_unique_substring(s):
    seen = {}
    max_len = 0
    start = 0

    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if char in seen and seen[char] >= start:
            start = seen[char] + 1
        seen[char] = i
        max_len = max(max_len, i - start + 1)

    return max_len
```

### Q3: What is the "minimum window substring" problem?
**Answer**:  
The **minimum window substring** problem asks you to find the smallest substring in the text that contains all characters of a given pattern. The sliding window technique is commonly used to solve this problem.

## 7. **Miscellaneous String Problems**

### Q1: How do you remove duplicate characters from a string?
**Answer**:  
You can use a set to track characters and build a new string:
```python
def remove_duplicates(s):
    seen = set()
    result = []
    for char in s:
        if char not in seen:
            result.append(char)
            seen.add(char)
    return ''.join(result)
```

### Q2: How would you convert a given string to an integer (`atoi` function)?
**Answer**:  
The `atoi` function converts a string to an integer by processing each character and multiplying by powers of 10:
```python
def atoi(s):
    result = 0
    sign = 1
    i = 0

    if s[0] == '-':
        sign = -1
        i = 1

    for char in s[i:]:
        result = result * 10 + ord(char) - ord('0')

    return sign * result
```
