## **Introduction**
The **Sliding Window** is a powerful technique often used to optimize problems involving arrays or strings. The concept involves maintaining a subset of elements (window) from the data structure and sliding this window across the input to optimize the problem-solving process.

---

## **Types of Sliding Window**

### **Fixed-size Sliding Window**
In this type, the window size is predefined and fixed. As the window slides over the array or string, elements enter and leave the window in a controlled manner.

### **Variable-size Sliding Window**
In the variable-size sliding window, the window's size can expand or shrink dynamically based on certain conditions. This is often used in problems where the target is not fixed but depends on the input data.

---

## **When to Use Sliding Window**
Sliding window techniques are ideal when:
- The problem involves contiguous subarrays or substrings.
- Brute force solutions involve recalculating overlapping regions.
- Optimization is needed in time complexity, such as improving O(nÂ²) approaches to O(n).

## **Fixed-size Sliding Window Examples**

### **Problem 1: Maximum Sum Subarray of Size K**

#### **Question**
Given an array of integers and a number `k`, find the maximum sum of a subarray of size `k`.

#### **Solution**
We can slide a window of size `k` across the array and keep track of the maximum sum as the window moves.

```python
def max_sum_subarray(arr, k):
    max_sum = 0
    window_sum = sum(arr[:k])
    max_sum = window_sum
    
    for i in range(len(arr) - k):
        window_sum = window_sum - arr[i] + arr[i + k]
        max_sum = max(max_sum, window_sum)
    
    return max_sum

# Example
arr = [2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2]
k = 3
print(max_sum_subarray(arr, k))  # Output: 9 (subarray [5, 1, 3])
```

---

### **Problem 2: Maximum Average Subarray of Size K**

#### **Question**
Find the maximum average value of a subarray of size `k`.

#### **Solution**
Instead of calculating sums, we calculate the averages as the window slides.

```python
def max_average_subarray(arr, k):
    window_sum = sum(arr[:k])
    max_average = window_sum / k
    
    for i in range(len(arr) - k):
        window_sum = window_sum - arr[i] + arr[i + k]
        max_average = max(max_average, window_sum / k)
    
    return max_average

# Example
arr = [1, 12, -5, -6, 50, 3]
k = 4
print(max_average_subarray(arr, k))  # Output: 12.75 (subarray [12, -5, -6, 50])
```

## **Variable-size Sliding Window Examples**

### **Problem 3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**

#### **Question**
Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

#### **Solution**
We use a sliding window that grows as we explore the string and shrinks if a duplicate character is encountered.

```python
def longest_substring_without_repeating(s):
    char_set = set()
    left = 0
    max_length = 0
    
    for right in range(len(s)):
        while s[right] in char_set:
            char_set.remove(s[left])
            left += 1
        char_set.add(s[right])
        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)
    
    return max_length

# Example
s = "abcabcbb"
print(longest_substring_without_repeating(s))  # Output: 3 ("abc")
```

---

### **Problem 4: Smallest Subarray With a Sum Greater Than or Equal to S**

#### **Question**
Given an array of positive integers and a number `S`, find the length of the smallest contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to `S`.

#### **Solution**
We expand the window to add elements until the sum is greater than or equal to `S`, then shrink the window to find the minimum length.

```python
def min_subarray_len(s, arr):
    window_sum = 0
    min_length = float("inf")
    left = 0
    
    for right in range(len(arr)):
        window_sum += arr[right]
        while window_sum >= s:
            min_length = min(min_length, right - left + 1)
            window_sum -= arr[left]
            left += 1
    
    return min_length if min_length != float("inf") else 0

# Example
arr = [2, 1, 5, 2, 3, 2]
s = 7
print(min_subarray_len(s, arr))  # Output: 2 (subarray [5, 2])
```

## **Advanced Sliding Window Problems**

### **Problem 5: Sliding Window Maximum**

#### **Question**
Given an array, find the maximum value in each subarray of size `k`.

#### **Solution**
We can use a deque (double-ended queue) to store the indices of useful elements for each window.

```python
from collections import deque

def max_sliding_window(arr, k):
    deq = deque()
    result = []
    
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        while deq and deq[0] < i - k + 1:
            deq.popleft()
        
        while deq and arr[deq[-1]] < arr[i]:
            deq.pop()
        
        deq.append(i)
        
        if i >= k - 1:
            result.append(arr[deq[0]])
    
    return result

# Example
arr = [1, 3, -1, -3, 5, 3, 6, 7]
k = 3
print(max_sliding_window(arr, k))  # Output: [3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7]
```

---

### **Problem 6: Subarrays with at Most K Distinct Integers**

#### **Question**
Given an array, find the number of subarrays with at most `K` distinct integers.

#### **Solution**
We can use the sliding window technique combined with a dictionary to track the frequency of elements in the current window.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def subarrays_with_k_distinct(arr, k):
    def at_most_k(k):
        count = defaultdict(int)
        left = 0
        result = 0
        
        for right in range(len(arr)):
            count[arr[right]] += 1
            while len(count) > k:
                count[arr[left]] -= 1
                if count[arr[left]] == 0:
                    del count[arr[left]]
                left += 1
            result += right - left + 1
        
        return result
    
    return at_most_k(k) - at_most_k(k - 1)

# Example
arr = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]
k = 2
print(subarrays_with_k_distinct(arr, k))  # Output: 7
```
