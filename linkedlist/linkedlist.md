## Introduction to Linked Lists

A **Linked List** is a linear data structure consisting of nodes. Each node contains:
- **Data**: The value stored in the node.
- **Pointer/Reference**: A reference to the next node in the list.

Linked lists are dynamic and provide flexibility for memory management compared to arrays.

---

## Types of Linked Lists

### Singly Linked List

A **Singly Linked List** is the simplest form, where each node points to the next node in the list. The last node points to `None`, indicating the end of the list.

#### Node Structure for Singly Linked List
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class SinglyLinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
```

### Doubly Linked List

A **Doubly Linked List** has nodes that point to both the next node and the previous node. This enables traversal in both directions.

#### Node Structure for Doubly Linked List
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None
        self.prev = None

class DoublyLinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
```

### Circular Linked List

In a **Circular Linked List**, the last node points back to the first node, creating a circular structure. This is useful in applications that require continuous traversal.

#### Node Structure for Circular Linked List
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class CircularLinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
```

---

## Basic Operations

### Traversal

Traversal involves visiting each node and processing the data.

#### Singly Linked List Traversal
```python
def traverse(self):
    current = self.head
    while current:
        print(current.data, end=" -> ")
        current = current.next
    print("None")
```

### Insertion

#### Insert at Beginning (Singly Linked List)
```python
def insert_at_beginning(self, data):
    new_node = Node(data)
    new_node.next = self.head
    self.head = new_node
```

#### Insert at End (Singly Linked List)
```python
def insert_at_end(self, data):
    new_node = Node(data)
    if self.head is None:
        self.head = new_node
        return
    last = self.head
    while last.next:
        last = last.next
    last.next = new_node
```

### Deletion

#### Delete by Value (Singly Linked List)
```python
def delete_by_value(self, key):
    current = self.head

    if current and current.data == key:
        self.head = current.next
        current = None
        return

    prev = None
    while current and current.data != key:
        prev = current
        current = current.next

    if current is None:
        return

    prev.next = current.next
    current = None
```

---

## Advanced Operations

### Reversing a Linked List

Reversing a linked list means reversing the direction of the `next` pointers.

#### Reverse a Singly Linked List
```python
def reverse(self):
    prev = None
    current = self.head
    while current:
        next_node = current.next
        current.next = prev
        prev = current
        current = next_node
    self.head = prev
```

### Detecting a Loop

To detect if a linked list contains a loop, we use Floyd's Cycle Detection algorithm (also called Tortoise and Hare Algorithm).

#### Detect a Loop in Singly Linked List
```python
def detect_loop(self):
    slow = self.head
    fast = self.head

    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow == fast:
            return True
    return False
```

### Merging Two Sorted Linked Lists

To merge two sorted linked lists into one sorted linked list.

#### Merging Algorithm
```python
def merge_sorted_lists(l1, l2):
    if not l1:
        return l2
    if not l2:
        return l1

    if l1.data < l2.data:
        l1.next = merge_sorted_lists(l1.next, l2)
        return l1
    else:
        l2.next = merge_sorted_lists(l1, l2.next)
        return l2
```

### Find the Middle of a Linked List

Finding the middle of a linked list can be achieved using two pointers (slow and fast).

#### Find Middle Node
```python
def find_middle(self):
    slow = self.head
    fast = self.head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
    return slow.data
```

---

## Special Algorithms

### Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm

This algorithm is used to detect a loop in a linked list using two pointers.

#### Floyd's Cycle Detection
```python
def detect_cycle(self):
    slow = self.head
    fast = self.head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow == fast:
            return True
    return False
```

### Flattening a Multi-level Linked List

Flattening a linked list means converting a multi-level list into a single-level list.

#### Flatten a Multi-level Linked List
```python
def flatten(self, head):
    if not head:
        return head
    current = head
    while current:
        if current.child:
            next_node = current.next
            child_list = self.flatten(current.child)
            current.next = child_list
            child_list.prev = current
            while current.next:
                current = current.next
            current.next = next_node
            if next_node:
                next_node.prev = current
        current = current.next
    return head
```

### LRU Cache Using Linked List

An **LRU Cache** (Least Recently Used) can be implemented using a doubly linked list and a hash map for O(1) access and updates.

#### Basic Structure of LRU Cache
```python
class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        self.cache = {}
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None

    # Add methods for get, put, and eviction.
```

---

## Memory Optimization in Linked Lists

### XOR Linked List

In an **XOR Linked List**, instead of storing two pointers (`next` and `prev`), we store the XOR of the two addresses.

#### Node Structure for XOR Linked List
```python
class XORNode:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.both = 0

class XORLinkedList:
    def __init__(self):
        self.head = None
        self.tail = None
```

#### Insert in XOR Linked List
```python
def insert(self, data):
    new_node = XORNode(data)
    if self.head is None:
        self.head = self.tail = new_node
    else:
        new_node.both = id(self.tail)
        self.tail.both = self.tail.both ^ id(new_node)
        self.tail = new_node
```

## Counting the Number of Nodes in a Linked List

To count the number of nodes in a linked list, you can traverse the list from the head to the end while maintaining a counter. Each time you move to the next node, increment the counter. Once you reach the end (where `current.next` is `None`), the counter will represent the total number of nodes.

## Steps:
1. Start at the **head** of the linked list.
2. Initialize a **counter** to 0.
3. Traverse the linked list node by node, incrementing the counter for each node.
4. When you reach the end of the list (i.e., `current` is `None`), return the counter.

## Code Implementation:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

class Solution:
    # Function to count the number of nodes in the linked list
    def countNodes(self, head):
        count = 0
        current = head
        
        # Traverse through the linked list
        while current:
            count += 1  # Increment the counter for each node
            current = current.next  # Move to the next node
        
        return count

# Example usage:
# Creating a linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
head = Node(1)
head.next = Node(2)
head.next.next = Node(3)
head.next.next.next = Node(4)

solution = Solution()

# Counting the number of nodes in the linked list
node_count = solution.countNodes(head)
print(f"Number of nodes in the linked list: {node_count}")
```

## Explanation:
- **Node Class**: Represents a node in the linked list, containing `data` and a `next` pointer to the next node.
- **countNodes Function**: 
  - Initializes `count = 0`.
  - Traverses the linked list, starting from the head. For each node encountered, it increments the `count`.
  - The function stops when `current` becomes `None`, which signifies the end of the linked list.
- **Example**: In the list `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4`, the count is `4`.

## Output:

For the linked list `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4`, the output will be:

```
Number of nodes in the linked list: 4
```

## Time and Space Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are only using a constant amount of space.
